# My Personal Dining Profile

**Overall Goal:** I want to find the most enjoyable dinner option for tonight. I value unique and high-quality food over standard fare.

**Meat Preferences:**
- My top favorite meats are beef (especially steak or short ribs) and a wide variety of seafood.
- I enjoy lamb.
- I like chicken wings, but I strongly dislike plain or dry chicken breast.
- Pork loin is my least favorite meat.

**Vegetable Preferences:**
- I love broccoli and napa cabbage.
- I strongly dislike green beans.
- Other vegetables are generally fine.

**Staple Food Preferences:**
- Pasta, noodles, and other similar dishes are my absolute highest priority. I'd almost always choose a good pasta dish.
- Sweet potatoes are a welcome side.
- Rice is neutral; it's just okay.

**Other Factors:**
- **Crowds:** I have a strong preference for less crowded places. A high activity level is a significant negative factor.
- **Uniqueness:** I give bonus points for creative, special, or non-standard menu items. If a dish seems unique, it's a big plus.
